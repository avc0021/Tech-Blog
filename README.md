# Install

After cloning the repo the NPM package manager will need to be installed using the command line terminal. This can be completed by invoking 'npm init' in the command line. Then 'npm install' will need to invoked as well to install the dependency files. Lastly, the application will need the following NPM pacakges: MySql2 ('npm i mysql2' will be needed to install package), Sequelize ('npm i sequelize' will be needed to install package), and Dotenv ('npm i dptenv' will be needed to install pacakge).

# Usage

This app can be launched using Heroku; in the future.
